You sprint through the trees, heart pounding, breath ragged. The forest grows denser, branches clawing at your arms as you push forward. Shadows twist and shift around you, but you don’t dare slow down.

Then—another misstep. Your foot catches on something hidden beneath the leaves, and you tumble forward.

Move to the END.
